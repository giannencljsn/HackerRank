    // hackerrank is organizing a chess tournament for its employees. There are n employees, each with unique ID from 1 to n and the employee ID x has a rating of rating[x]. Two employees can form a team if they have the same rating and each employee can be part of only one team. There are q queries, each of the form (l,r). 
    // For each query, determine the maximum number of teams that can be formed from employees with IDs between l and r inclusive. Each query is independent of others. For example: n=4 rating = [2,3,4,2] q = 2 queries = [[1,4],[3,4]] 
    // For the first query all employees are considered. Employees with IDs 1 and 4 can be teamed as their ratings are the same. There are no other team formations possible. The number of teams are 1. For the second query, employees 3 and 4 are considered, their ratings are 4,2. Since their ratings are different no teams can be formed. The number of teams are 0. The answer is [1,0]
